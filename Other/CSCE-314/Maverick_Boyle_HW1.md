I finished question 2.

The implementations of part 1 and 2 are the way they are described in the problem. Just compile and run with the inputs formatted the way they’re described in the problem.

I’m still a bit confused on hashCode and I’m still going to try question 3. I just ran out of time. If I don’t have it done soon, I’ll ask for help.
